# number-guessing-game
The Number Guessing Game is a simple yet engaging Python program where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides feedback on each guess, indicating whether it's too high or too low, until the user guesses the correct number. The game also tracks the number of attempts taken.
